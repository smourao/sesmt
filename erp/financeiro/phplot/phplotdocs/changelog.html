Reference sections were changed to add a History subsection, detailing
behavior in previous releases. This information was previously in the Notes

Updates to Part III, Developer's Guide for changes in internal functions
used for text handling and margin/scale processing. Updated figure showing
the plot layout.
      </p><p>
Added new chapter to Developer's Guide on the callbacks feature, and added
documentation of the 3 public functions used with callbacks to the Function
Reference. The text is based on the <code class="filename">Callbacks</code> file
which was included with PHPlot-5.0.4 (and will removed in the next release).
Although this is now documented in the manual,
the callbacks feature is still considered experimental.

Added new Part III - PHPlot Developer's Guide. This includes two layout figures

material for maintainers of PHPlot, but may be of use to others as well.
More text may be added to this part in the future.
      </p><p>
Document the requirement that style arrays use zero-based sequential integer
indexes only. This includes colors, point shapes/sizes, line widths, and
line styles.

Released updated version of the manual to correspond to PHPlot-5.0rc3.
Documented new Y data labels for bar charts and line/point suppression.
Add a note on how to get borderless, unshaded bars (needed due to a recent
bug fix).

      </p><p>
Updates were applied to the installation section to match the README
included with 5.0rc3.  Minimum PHP level corrected to 4.3.0, and noted that
PHP 5 works, as this has now been tested. Deleted note about included
examples and documentation; these have been removed from the release.
      </p><p>
Three examples which use random data where changed to use a fixed seed,
so the results are repeatable.
      </p><p>
A new example was added, showing a bar chart with data labels.
